* Installation
On MacOS, I specifically use ~d12frosted/emacs-plus~:
https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus

Here are the commands I've used:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus —-with-ctags —-with-dbus —-with-debug —-with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp --with-modern-black-variant-icon
#+END_SRC

** Tree Sitter
I use ~tree-sitter~, which can have language grammars installed via
~M-x treesit-install-language-grammer~.

** Language Server Protocols
I rely upon ~solargraph~ as my Ruby LSP: https://solargraph.org/.
* Viewing my configuration

My config follows the comment structure outlined here:
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Comment-Tips.html

The structure is the following:
- ~;~:
  - align comment to the same column to the right of the code, explain how
    code on that line does it's job
- ~;;~:
  - align comment to the same level of indentation of the code, describe
    purpose of following lines or state of program at that point
  - also used for comments outside of functions
- ~;;;~:
  - start at left margin, used for comments to be considered headings
- ~;;;;~:
  - start at left margin, used for headings of major sections

Additionally, I like to use comments to link to the specific source of the
package that I'm using.

Everything is wrapped in ~use-package~. ~consult-outline~ can be used to jump
from each ~use-package~ declaration.

* Resources
Here are various resources I've referenced in the past that has helped make my
emacs configuration what it is today:
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/np6ey4/how_packageel_works_with_use_package/?share_id=s3jeiLwvmdsvfIvV-Jpm_][Reddit post on package.el and use-package]]
  - Very interesting read on ~package.el~ and ~use-package~ - it shows how to
    have more control of ~package.el~ and making your config files reflect
    what is installed
  - I mentioned this very post in a [[https://bsky.app/profile/cyrialize.dev/post/3lbpioughgc24][thread on Bluesky]]
- https://manueluberti.eu/posts/2021-03-08-package/
  - Good post on ~straight~ versus just using ~package.el~ - I agree with it, which is why I also dropped ~straight~
  - ~straight~ is still an amazing package though, and I wouldn't be surprised if I switched back to it

** Advice
General pieces of advice I've collected throughout my time with Emacs.

*** Use Package
"In general, you should keep :init forms as simple and quick as possible,
 and put as much as you can get away with into the :config block.
 This way, deferred loading can help your Emacs to start as quickly
 as possible."

[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package?tab=readme-ov-file#information-about-package-loads][From the use-package readme]]

If you are having trouble understanding why your ~use-package~ declaration isn't working, try placing your cursor after the declaration and doing ~M-x pp-macroexpand-last-sexp~. This command prints out the actual code that ~use-package~ generates.

* To Dos
** TODO update awesome emacs to include
fido-mode
tempo (snippet)
skeleton(snippet)
hippie expand (completion)
project.el (project mgmt)
** TODO set up tempel and hippie expand
** TODO set up dumb jump
** TODO set up auto updating packages
** TODO Check out lsp-bridge
Is it possible to have it work alongside ~corfu~, when you aren't using it?

Basically, doing something like toggling ~corfu~ off when ~lsp-bridge~ is
turned on.
** TODO Update chruby code to work with auto switching
https://github.com/plexus/chruby.el is an old package that doesn't support the
auto switching of chruby - e.g. the auto detection of .ruby-version and changing
accordingly
** TODO Update Ruby hooks to run chruby-use-corresponding when opening a ruby file or project
If no ~.ruby-version~ is found within the project or globally, then default to a setting within ~init.el~
** TODO Create a function that downloads tree sitter code you need
** TODO Write code to check if tree sitter is installed
** TODO Create a function to check if a file starts with shell shebang
** TODO Set up preferred package settings for use-package
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/np6ey4/how_packageel_works_with_use_package/?share_id=s3jeiLwvmdsvfIvV-Jpm_][See this reddit post.]]

Set up code to have a ~use-package~ keyword for specifying that a package is
part of ~package-selected-packages~.
** TODO Read use-package manual
** TODO Read vertico manual
** TODO Read embark manual
** TODO Read consult manual
** TODO Read marginalia manual
** TODO Read orderless manual
** TODO Jump to Emacs 30
I may switch from ~straight~ to just using ~use-package~ with ~:vc~

** TODO Look into the package ~citre~

This was previously used when setting up ~ctags~ with the project.

This is an example configuration I had:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; From here: https://github.com/universal-ctags/citre
(use-package citre
  :defer t
  :init
  ;; This is needed in `:init' block for lazy load to work.
  (require 'citre-config)
  ;; Bind your frequently used commands.  Alternatively, you can define them
  ;; in `citre-mode-map' so you can only use them when `citre-mode' is enabled.
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x c j") 'citre-jump)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x c J") 'citre-jump-back)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x c P") 'citre-ace-peek)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x c p") 'citre-peek)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x c u") 'citre-update-this-tags-file)
  :config
  (setq
   ;; Set these if readtags/ctags is not in your path.
   citre-readtags-program "/usr/local/bin/readtags"
   citre-ctags-program "/usr/local/bin/ctags"
   ;; Set this if you use project management plugin like projectile.  It's
   ;; used for things like displaying paths relatively, see its docstring.
   citre-project-root-function #'projectile-project-root
   ;; Set this if you want to always use one location to create a tags file.

   ;; See the "Create tags file" section above to know these options
   citre-use-project-root-when-creating-tags t
   citre-prompt-language-for-ctags-command t
   ;; By default, when you open any file, and a tags file can be found for it,
   ;; `citre-mode' is automatically enabled.  If you only want this to work for
   ;; certain modes (like `prog-mode'), set it like this.
   citre-auto-enable-citre-mode-modes '(prog-mode)))

;; Fallback to Citre if reference can't be found within LSP
;; From: https://github.com/universal-ctags/citre/wiki/Use-Citre-together-with-lsp-mode

        (citre-fetcher

      (or (with-demoted-errors "%s, fallback to citre"

  "Completion backend of Citre.  Execute COMMAND with ARG and IGNORED."
  (interactive (list 'interactive))
  (cl-case -command
    (interactive (company-begin-backend 'company-citre))
    (prefix (and (bound-and-true-p citre-mode)
                 (or (citre-get-symbol) 'stop)))
    (meta (citre-get-property 'signature -arg))
